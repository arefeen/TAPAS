# TAPAS: Tool for Alternative Polyadenylation Site Analysis

Accoring to the central dogma of molecular biology, a pre-mRNA is synthesized from the coding sequence of a gene during the transcriptional process. This pre-mRNA is coverted to a mature mRNA by the post-transcriptional process. Post-transcriptional process contains three major steps. One of these steps is the addition of polyadenylation (polyA) tail using the polyadenylation pocess. Therefore, the polyadenylation process has two steps: cleavage the 3' end of a pre-mRNA and addition of a polyA tail at the cleavage site. But, due to certain *cis*-acting elements and *trans*-acting factors alternative cleavage sites can be formed from a pre-mRNA. More precisely, a single pre-mRNA can produce more than one mRNA with 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of different lengths. TAPAS is a RNA-Seq based tool for detecting these alternative polyadenylation cleavage sites (APSs) with in a gene. If two biological samples with multiple replicates are given, TAPAS indentifies the differentially expressed APSs between these samples. It can also extend its differential analysis to identify shortening/lengthening event genes between the samples.
